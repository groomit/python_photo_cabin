A raspberry pi based photo-cabin. 
It takes pictures using a simple USB webcam and directly prints it using a thermal printer.
For controlling the thermal printer, I used the Adafruit library. Also the code for the button is basically lent from the adafruit-camera cam.py project.

Image resolution is not very high due to printer limitations.
