A raspberry pi based photo-cabin. 
It takes pictures using a simple USB webcam and directly prints it using a thermal printer.
For controlling the thermal printer, I used the Adafruit thermal printer library (adafruit/Python-Thermal-Printer). Also the code for the button is basically lent from the adafruit-pi-cam project (adafruit/adafruit-pi-cam).

Image resolution is not very high due to printer limitations.
